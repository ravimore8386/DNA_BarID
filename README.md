# DNA BarID (DNA Barcode Identification)

## DNA BarID (DNA Barcode Identification) is a tool for rapid taxonomic identification of nearly full length 16S rRNA sequences based on QR-codes (regular expressions). 

### About DNA BarID
In order to taxonomic classification of 16S rRNA data, there is a need for easy-to-use computer program, containing fast computational regular expression based method.

For demonstration purpose, we targeted phylum Firmicutes and dominating taxa in particular, and obtained high sensitivity and specificity of regular expressions at class, order, family and genus level.

Bacilli (Class)
Bacillales (Order)
Bacillaceae (Family)
Bacillus (Genus)

The pattern based approach adopted in this tool could help in molecular based taxonomic identification for other phyla predominant in particular niche, thereby assisting classification of unknowns at least at higher taxonomic levels (class and order).

### Features
Windows based graphics-based user friendly interface

It accepts FASTA format 16S rRNA sequences (.fasta/.txt/.fa/.seq/.fna extension file).

Export analysis results in respective text files.

Users can encode or decode QR-codes.

### Downloads

### System Requirements:

1. DNA BarID tool is tested on Windows 7 operating system.Windows 7 and 8 (32-bit and 64-bit). 
Currently not available for Macintosh, Linux and other platforms. 

2. The minimum computer requirements: 2 GB of RAM and 100 GB of available hard disk space (on C: drive) with a Intel PentiumÂ® processor.

3. If Microsoft .NET Framework 4 is not pre-installed, in this case it will automatically get install.

(Note: Please keep internet connection enable during installations for download supporting files.)

### Installation Steps:
```
Step 1: Download DNA BarID Windows executables (32/64-bit) package.

Step 2: Extract the zip file and run the 'setup.exe' file from folder

Step 3: Follow the setup wizard by clicking next button as shown in following figures.

Step 4: After sucessful installation, open DNA BarID tool by either option of double click on icon appeared on desktop or open from start menu.

Note: DNA BarID tool create folder at C:\Users\username\Documents\DNA_BarID for its processing, dont delete at any intance.

In order to uninstall, go to the Start Menu-Control Panel-Programs-Programs and Features-click uninstall

```

### Quick Start Steps:

```
Step 1: Go to Sequence menu - 'Open Sequence File' - choose either 'Sample Sequence File' or 'Browse' file from your computer location.

Step 2: Go to Barcode menu - 'Open QR DNA Barcode' - choose either 'Sample QR DNA Barcode' (ex. Bacillaceae (Family).png) or Browse QR code.

OR

Go to Barcode menu - 'Select All QR DNA Barcodes' to search againest all DNA barcodes at a time (such as Bacilli, Bacillales, Bacillaceae and Bacillus).

Step 3: Click on 'Search Barcodes' for taxonomic classification.

Step 4: After searching, click on 'Show Result' to view result summery.

Step 5: then click on 'Export Output' and save files in your desired target folder (ex. Desktop/Result)

Step 6: Go to target folder (ex. Desktop/Result) and check results files.

In case of single barcodes, three files will be generated and for all barcodes, it will generated two files for each barcode along with summery file.
